I have been walking for a long time. Left leg up, plant, right leg up, plant, left leg up ... The steps are mechanical now. It's been close to ten hours on the trail having started at 4 AM in the morning. My body is starting to give up. No wonder really! I haven't had any sleep for the last 36 hours, am slighlty dehydrated and the adrenaline push from the morning is no longer present. This hike was supposed to kick my butt and it has lived up to it's billing. 

I'm not alone. I have a few friends. But they are a little behind. Every now and then I selfishly break away from them. To be alone, to not have the social connection for some time, to enjoy nature, to let the wind talk to me, to let the sunlight touch my body, to listen to the rustling of the leaves, to smell the scent of the flowers, to see everything around me; to really be in wilderness. I broke away from them again when I reached the trail crest. The final part of the hike to the summit will have to be done alone, as I had imagined.

And as they say at Mt. Whitney, "The rest was all downhill"
