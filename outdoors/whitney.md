I'm not alone. I have a few friends. But they are a little behind. Every now and then I selfishly break away from them. To be alone, to not have the social connection for some time, to enjoy nature, to let the wind talk to me, to let the sunlight touch my body, to listen to the rustling of the leaves, to smell the scent of the flowers, to see everything around me; to really be in wilderness.
