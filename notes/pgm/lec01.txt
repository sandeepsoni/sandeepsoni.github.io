Representation of Bayes Nets
============================

A Bayes Network is a compact representation of various 
factors within the probabilistic model and how these
factors are related to one another. The network encodes
conditional independence assumptions amongst the factors
and one can describe the joint probability model into a
factorized model based on these independencies.

A Bayes network also enables us with reasoning patterns,
particularly the three described in Koller's textbook

a) Causal Reasoning : After observing the effect, one finds
   out the likelihood of the effect. In other words, as
   described in the textbook, we predict the downstream
   effects of the causes.

b) Evidentiary Reasoning: After observing the effect, one
   reasons about the causes for the effect. In other words,
   what would be an explanation for the observed effect.

c) Intercausal Reasoning: In case of multiple inter related 
   causes for a particular effect, how "knowing something"
   about one of the causes might explain away the effect.

   The third pattern is particulary interesting but needs to
   be studied more in detail.


One of the main benefits of a Bayesian Network is the
compactness in representation. If we consider the joint
distribution without any of the conditional independence
assumptions then there are exponentially large number
of parameters in the joint model compared to the factorized
model corresponding to the Bayes Network. This significant
decrease in the number of parameters is advantageous:
computationally, storage wise as well as in terms of
interpretation.
